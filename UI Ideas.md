# UI Ideas

Keeping track so we don't forget!

In all cases, think usable on mobile (mobile first), but not ugly on browser

* Log in, Log out pages
  * Only needs text and a button, Login is handled by a Google auth dialog
* Summary page (Home page)
    * You're X.XX ahead/behind
    * over/under bar graph
    * Other stats?
* Item list page
    * list of expenses with date, user, expense, and cost.
        * Remove button or long press or something for each
        * Button for showing pictures? Long press menu on mobile?
    * fields to add new ones,  maybe to add pictures
 * Group selection/joining
    * Some way to indicate when entered group can't be found.
    * probably idenfity groups with a number or hash
 * Settings page?
    * Color preference, etc
 
 * Some way to switch between all these. a side menu? Hamburger buttons are falling out of style
